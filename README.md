# 2048 AI

The project implemented an advanced version of classical game 2048 with Monte Carlo Tree Search.

Specifically, it has the following modifications:
* **Game Mode**: Game players are allowed to swipe horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
* **Board Size**: The game board is 4x4 by default, and can be enlarged up to 10Ã—10. 
The larger the game board is, the larger the game goal is.

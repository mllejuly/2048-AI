# 2048 AI

The project implemented an advanced version of classical game 2048 with tree search and machine learning algorithm.

Specifically, it has the following modifications:
* **Game Mode**: Game players are allowed to swipe horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
* **Board Size**: The game board is 4x4 by default, and can be enlarged up to 50Ã—50. The larger the game board is, the larger the game goal is. 
`game goal = 2 ^ (game size + 7)`
